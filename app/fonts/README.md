# Proxima Nova Font Files

Place your Proxima Nova font files in this directory with the following names:

- `ProximaNova-Regular.woff2` (weight: 400)
- `ProximaNova-Semibold.woff2` (weight: 600)
- `ProximaNova-Bold.woff2` (weight: 700)
- `ProximaNova-Black.woff2` (weight: 900)

## Alternative: Using fonts from public folder

If you prefer to keep fonts in `/public/fonts/`, you can update the paths in `/app/layout.tsx` to:
- `"../../public/fonts/ProximaNova-Regular.woff2"` etc.

## File formats

If you have different file formats (woff, ttf, otf), you can update the font paths in `/app/layout.tsx` to match your file names and extensions.
